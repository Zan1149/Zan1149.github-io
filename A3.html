    <h2>"KPI of the Rainforest" · Story Opening</h2>
    <p>
     In 2049, the invention of Nature Communication Devices will allow nature to stop being silent and make “nature's voice” heard.<br><br>
     Nature Communication Devices were initially used to protect the environment, monitor natural disasters and protect endangered animals. However, after being widespread, Nature Communication Devices were widely used by corporations and governments and even spawned a set of specialized management scores for the environment - the Natural Resource Evaluation System (NRES). A set of artificial intelligence-based “nature KPI” is composed of air purification rate, bio-interaction activity, tourism experience score, and business potential assessment.<br><br>
     Nature is no longer a wild habitat but a managed, controllable performance unit that generates data.<br><br>

    <p>
      People realize that since nature cannot have a voice, its interests are expressed by other stakeholders, such as managers, investors and even society. Therefore, the need to represent nature's voice can lead to conflicts of interest (Pesci, Gelmini & Vola, 2024).<br><br>
      Zora hesitated. She reconnected using her old-model receiver, which had unstable frequency and a blurry interface, but suddenly a fragmented synthetic voice came through:
      <br>“…We are still here… Please do not measure us with your formulas…”
      <br>It was the rainforest's voice, not the structured language of KPIs, but a composite tone blending wind, water, and animal whispers—unclassifiable and unable to be recorded by the system. She reconnected over a dozen times, and each segment she heard was different, but they all shared one common thread: mourning.
      <br>Not anger, not a distress signal, but a deep, slow decay.
      <br>She attempted to upload these “non-standard data,” but the system deemed it “emotional expression recognition failed, unable to map to scoring metrics.”
      <br>—In natural data, there is no option for “mourning.”
