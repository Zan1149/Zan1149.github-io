            <div>
                <p>The core of the technology is a biosensing module, a multi-species semantic learning model, and a visualization interface.</p>

                <h3>Biosensing module</h3>
                <p>To be more detailed, firstly, the biosensing module monitors and records the changes of living organisms by setting up devices with multi-dimensional sensing technologies such as cameras and sensors to capture different dimensions such as vibration frequencies, odor signals, sounds, etc., such as the frequency of animals' cries, the signal response of plants, and the amplitude of vibration of water flow and mountains. Sensor technologies have not only expanded the scope of data collection but have also improved its accuracy. This continuous and comprehensive monitoring of nature has helped to stimulate new forms of democratic organization and communication on environmental issues in a monitored environment, thus contributing to the development of relevant policies and actions (Gabrys, 2016).</p>

                <h3>Multi-species semantic learning model</h3>
                <p>Multi-species semantic learning models are used to record and continuously learn the language systems and expression patterns of a variety of different species through AI.AI technology is not only being used to decode species' communication styles and to recognize their emotional expressions, but it can also help people to better understand the sounds of nature (Gruber & Rodríguez-Garavito, 2025). According to Ravignani et al. (2019), the vocalizations of different species display unique rhythmic characteristics. In the device's core algorithm, these rhythms are converted into “rhythmic fingerprints” that are compared with multi-species rhythmic samples stored in a database to identify the source of the signal and complete the initial translation (Ravignani et al., 2019). At the same time, AI technology can be combined with a sensing module to monitor and evaluate all aspects of the environment (Olawade et al., 2024), performing a twenty-four hour non-stop recording of environmental changes. </p>

                <h3>visualization interface</h3>
                <p>The visualization interface is to show the translated information to the user in graphical form to increase the immersion of the user.<br>
